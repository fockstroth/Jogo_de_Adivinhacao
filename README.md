My first read me, hello guys, I'm trying to learn this new language
so this is symbolizes my first and very audacious step to the coding world

If you are reading this trying to find some rust tutorial, shame, this code is like to be in the very first manual

If you are a job reviwer, this is the way I code, I dont have any idea if this the better way to do it, but i'm doing
and learning more every day, I aways study to get better, and this is my initial point to this.

If you are curious about the code, it's a simple sintax revision about an manual chalenge to do a game where you need
to pick the right number.

There are some coments and other easter eggs I'm going to leave behind. "Or Am I not"?
